Harvard pays its professors roughly 40% more than regional state universities. Stanford matches this. MIT does too. 

Is this waste? Are elite universities throwing money around? Or does the salary premium reflect something real—genuine differences in talent, scarcity, and how elite institutions compete?

We set out to answer this question using a simple idea: track what happens to a professor's salary when they move. If elite universities overpay, we should see sharp salary penalties when academics leave Harvard for a regional university. We don't.

## The puzzle

Economists have long wondered whether prestige premiums in labor markets reflect real productivity differences or just social hierarchy. Do top law firms pay 40% more because their lawyers are 40% better? Do elite universities pay Harris $150,000 instead of $110,000 because Harris is genuinely more productive at Harvard than at Nebraska?

The problem with answering this is selection. We can't tell whether Harvard's professors earn more because Harvard hires better people, or because Harvard pays for excellence, or both. Compare a Harvard professor's salary to a Nebraska professor's salary, and you're comparing different people.

Unless they move.

When a top researcher moves from Nebraska to Harvard, we can see what happens to their salary in the same market. When another researcher moves the opposite direction—from Harvard to a regional university—we can see what they lose (or gain). These moves let us separate the person from the institution.

## What we found

We analyzed data on faculty moves across US universities using matched employer-employee records. The results reversed the conventional story.

**Finding 1: Elite universities don't overpay. They operate in a separate market.**

Faculty earn more at elite institutions because elite universities compete primarily with *each other*. A Harvard researcher worried about losing talent isn't competing against Ohio State. Harvard is competing against Stanford. Stanford is competing against MIT. 

The bidding war happens at the top. This segmented market—where the elite subset competes intensely among themselves while non-elite universities operate in a different equilibrium—explains the salary gap without requiring overpayment.

**Finding 2: The surprising mobility pattern.**

In most labor markets, people move up the hierarchy for pay. A talented engineer at a regional firm might move to Silicon Valley and get a 30% raise. That's why top talent concentrates.

Academia is different. We find academics move both *toward and away from* elite institutions with roughly equal frequency. And here's the key: **they get salary increases either way.**

A professor might leave MIT for a teaching-focused university and still negotiate a raise. Another might move from a state school to Stanford and also get more money. The salary increase isn't correlated with moving "up."

This breaks the traditional model. In hierarchical labor markets, what holds people at lower rungs is lower pay. When you see people leaving the top, they're usually taking pay cuts. But in academia, they aren't.

**Finding 3: It's about the market, not the worker.**

Individual fixed effects—differences between professors—explain surprisingly little of the elite university salary premium. What matters instead is *which market you're in*. 

This is the critical insight. The elite university salary premium is largely a market-level phenomenon, not a worker-level one. It's not that Harvard has discovered a genius-identifying algorithm that attracts disproportionately talented people. It's that Harvard participates in a different labor market with different competitive dynamics.

## Why this happens

Two features of academic labor markets make this pattern possible.

**Academic productivity is visible.** Unlike many fields where quality is hard to assess, a professor's research productivity is public. Publication records, citation counts, and reputation are essentially impossible to fake. When Harvard hires someone, the administration knows what it's getting because the candidate's track record is on display.

This visibility means elite universities aren't paying for obscure "talent" they've somehow detected. They're paying for demonstrated ability that the entire market can see. That constrains how much they can overpay relative to actual quality.

**The academic job market is extremely thin.** Faculty positions don't open constantly. A researcher might be perfect for a position at their dream university, but it might take years for that institution to have a relevant opening. When it finally does, the competition isn't broad—it's among a few other elite institutions also recruiting that year.

This thinness creates intense bidding at the top end of the market. But it also means most recruitment happens within competitive tiers. Elite universities rarely recruit from non-elite pools (and vice versa), not because of discrimination, but because these are genuinely different markets with different entry points and moving costs.

The result: market segmentation sustains the salary premium without requiring overpayment or inefficiency.

## What this means

**For university rankings:** The elite university premium isn't waste. It reflects real differences in resources, talent density, and institutional capacity. University prestige rankings—while subject to criticism—aren't just marketing. They reflect genuine competitive differentiation.

**For understanding higher education hierarchy:** The concentration of talent and resources at elite institutions isn't driven by overcompensation. It's driven by market segmentation that, paradoxically, can be stable even without persistent overpayment at the margin.

**For policy:** This raises harder questions than simple overpayment. The real issue isn't whether elite universities pay too much. It's whether concentrating talent and resources at a small number of institutions is good for the knowledge economy overall. That's a question about equity, innovation distribution, and access—not about market efficiency.

If anything, the fact that elite universities *don't* need to overpay dramatically to retain talent (because faculty mobility is constrained by market thinness) suggests the market is working mostly efficiently. What's worth questioning is whether that efficient outcome is desirable.

## The bottom line

Elite universities pay 40% more than regional institutions, but they don't overpay. The premium reflects a bifurcated labor market where elite institutions compete intensely with each other while non-elite universities operate in a different equilibrium. 

The real puzzle in higher education isn't wasteful spending. It's market structure.
