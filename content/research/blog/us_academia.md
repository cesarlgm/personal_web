In most industries, some firms pay more than others—even for seemingly similar workers. Economists have shown that employees who move to higher-paying firms typically receive wage increases, while those moving to lower-paying firms experience comparable losses. These persistent differences across employers are often interpreted as *firm effects* or even *rents*—a share of firm-specific advantages captured by workers.

Universities appear to fit this pattern. There is a clear prestige hierarchy, and faculty at elite institutions earn higher salaries on average. It is therefore natural to think that top universities pay a premium.

But this intuition turns out to be misleading.

In this paper, we show that **elite universities do not systematically pay more for the same faculty**. Instead, they pay more because they hire higher-paid, more productive academics.


## A familiar pattern—at first glance

As in other sectors, academic salaries are strongly correlated with institutional prestige. Faculty at top-ranked universities earn more on average, and these institutions have greater resources and visibility.

However, average differences can be misleading. To understand whether universities themselves pay more, we need to compare what the *same faculty member* would earn across institutions.



## Prestige does not imply higher pay

Using longitudinal data on US STEM faculty and a standard two-way fixed effects (AKM) framework, we separate the role of individual characteristics from institutional effects.

We find that:

- Differences across universities explain **very little** of salary variation  
- Most of the variation is explained by **individual faculty characteristics**

In other words, **elite universities do not pay a meaningful premium for identical academics**.

Even when comparing the most and least prestigious institutions, the implied salary differences—holding faculty quality constant—are modest.



## Mobility looks very different from other labor markets

Academic careers also exhibit unusual mobility patterns.

In most labor markets:
- Workers tend to move **up the job ladder**
- Moving down typically comes with a pay cut

In academia, neither holds:

- Moves **up and down the prestige hierarchy are equally common**
- **Salaries increase after a move—regardless of direction**

Faculty moving to less prestigious institutions often still receive substantial pay increases.


## Why do elite universities pay more on average?

If elite institutions do not pay more for the same faculty, why are their average salaries higher?

The answer is straightforward:

> **They hire better-paid faculty.**

There is strong sorting across institutions: more productive academics—measured through publications, citations, and career trajectories—are more likely to work at more prestigious universities.

Thus, the observed salary differences reflect **who institutions hire**, not **how much they pay for a given individual**.



## A different model of the academic labor market

We argue that two key features distinguish academia from most labor markets:

### 1. High information about productivity  
Academic output (publications, citations, grants) is highly visible, allowing institutions to assess researchers’ quality early in their careers.

### 2. Scarce and irregular job openings  
Departments hire infrequently and often in narrow fields, meaning that good matches are not always available when candidates enter the market.



## A market of imperfect matches

These features lead to a labor market shaped by mismatch and gradual improvement:

- Initial job matches are often imperfect  
- Moves—whether up or down in prestige—improve the match  
- Better matches translate into **higher productivity and higher salaries**

This explains why:
- Mobility is symmetric across the prestige ladder  
- Moves in both directions are associated with pay increases  
- Institutional “rents” are limited or absent  


## Implications

Our findings suggest that academia operates under a different logic than most labor markets:

- Limited role for employer-specific wage premia  
- Strong sorting of talent across institutions  
- Mobility driven by match quality rather than hierarchy alone  

More broadly, the results highlight how **information and the timing of job opportunities** shape labor market outcomes.

Elite universities do not necessarily pay more—they employ faculty who would earn more almost anywhere.
