        Thank you for visiting my personal webpage! I am an **Early Career Researcher** at the [**School of Economics of the University of Edinburgh**](https://www.ed.ac.uk/economics). 
        
        I am primarily a labor economist working on topics in both **labor** and **development economics**. I am particularly interested in issues related to gender inequality, skill acquisition, and education.

        I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from [**Boston University**](https://www.bu.edu/econ/). I pronounce my name as [ˈse.saɾ].
