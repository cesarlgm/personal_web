It is well known that big U.S. cities pay higher wages, but there is growing evidence that this urban wage premium declined since the eighties (Autor, 2019). In this paper, I use data from U.S. Commuting Zones for the period between 1970 and 2020 to document that the decline in the urban wage premium affected men and women differently. While women were relatively isolated from the premium decline, men with lower education received the brunt of the impact. This caused a large relative increase in women’s urban wage premium: women’s premium went from being on par with men’s in 1970 to being 44% larger in 2010. I go on to argue that these differential trends result from a combination of gender specialization and the evolution of urban skill premiums. Urban premiums decline the most in those skills low-education men use more intensively.
