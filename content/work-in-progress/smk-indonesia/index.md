Building a labor force with adequate technical skills is a pressing challenge for less developed countries (Atkin et al., 2019). Secondary education and, in particular, vocational high schools play a crucial role in addressing this issue. Globally, vocational high schools serve more than 48 million students across low and middle-income countries (EdStats 2022). In this paper, we evaluate the effect of a mass training program for vocational high-school teachers in Indonesia. In 2020, the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) rolled out a professional development program for vocational high-school teachers. This was a targeted, intensive training program that matched teachers with potential employers of vocational graduates. These potential employers then provide technical training to teachers. We evaluate the effect of this program on teachers’ knowledge, classroom practices, and teachers' expectations of their students’ outcomes. Our results suggest training had little effect on all outcomes. Moreover, we show that teachers not exposed to this training program did get vocational training on their own. Overall, our results suggest there is little need for the government to provide this kind of professional development program.
